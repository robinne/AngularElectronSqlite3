Basic Angular2, electron, sqlite3.
Manually created/from angular2 website recommendations.

>tsc
 Cannot find name 'Promise'
 
 upgraded typings (deleted typings directory so it would get created again). All OK.
 
 npm install sqlite3 --save
 
Add basic server.js, include express, run server.

>npm install -g electron-rebuild
>.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd
